	abstract = {Background {QT} prolongation is an important biomarker of the arrhythmia torsades de pointes and appears to be related mainly to blockade of delayed inward cardiac rectifier potassium currents. The aim of this study was to quantify the relationship between in vitro human ether-a-go-go-related gene ({hERG}) potassium channel blockade and the magnitude of {QT} prolongation in humans for the class {III} antiarrhythmic dofetilide. Methods The in vitro affinity and activity of dofetilide were determined in recombinant cell cultures expressing the {hERG} channel, and the {QT}-prolonging effect of dofetilide was assessed in 5 clinical studies (80 healthy volunteers and 17 patients with ischemic heart disease). A population pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic analysis of the in vitro and in vivo data was performed in {NONMEM} by use of the operational model of pharmacologic agonism to estimate the efficiency of transduction from ion channel binding to Fridericia-corrected {QT} response. Results A 3-compartment pharmacokinetic model with first-order absorption characterized the time course of dofetilide concentrations. On the basis of an in vitro potency of 5.13 ng/{mL} for potassium current inhibition and predicted unbound dofetilide concentrations, the estimated transducer ratio (τ) of 6.2 suggests that the {QT} response plateaus before currents are fully blocked. In our study population, 10\% {hERG} blockade corresponds to a {QT} prolongation of 20 ms (95\% confidence interval, 12–32 ms). With long-term dofetilide administration, tolerance develops with a half-life of 4.7 days. Conclusions The current mechanism-based pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic model quantified the relationship between in vitro {hERG} channel blockade and clinical {QT} prolongation for dofetilide. This model may prove valuable for assessing the risk of {QT} prolongation in humans for other drugs that selectively block the {hERG} channel on the basis of in vitro assays and pharmacokinetic properties.

	abstract = {Short {QT}-interval is a condition that bear the suspicion of short {QT} syndrome ({SQTS}). {SQTS} is known to increase risk of life-threatening arrythmias and sudden  cardiac death ({SCD}). Due to the insufficient population-based studies and use of  various {QT} cut-off values, it accounts for as an undiagnosed condition. In this  study, we sought for prevalence of short {QT} interval in Kherameh cohort study,  one of the southern branches of the Prospective Epidemiological Research Studies  in Iran ({PERSIAN}). Data of 4363 adult subjects were analyzed from phase 1 of the  cohort during 2014-2017. The corrected {QT} ({QTc}) intervals were calculated and  electrocardiograms ({ECGs}) with {QTc} of less than 370 ms (msec) were reanalyzed for  bradycardia, early repolarization, atrial fibrillation ({AF}), arrhythmias, and  other electrical conduction abnormalities. Seventy-two subjects (1.65\%) had a {QTc}  of less than 370 ms (mean {QTc} of 360.72 ± 11.72). A male predominance and a lower  mean heart rate observed in {SQTS} susceptible group (M/F of 1/0.26 vs. 1/1.145,  p-value {\textless} 0.0001; 58.389 ± 9.787 vs. 70.899 ± 11.775; p-value {\textless} 0.0001) compare  to the subjects with normal {QTc}. At least, 2 subjects with high-probability {SQTS}  and 3 with intermediate-probability {SQTS} identified. The frequency of {AF},  syncope, bradycardia, early repolarization, low voltage {ECG}, and infantile {SCD} in  first- and second-degree relatives were 16.67, 4.17, 33.33, 11.11, 11.11, 11.11\%,  respectively. The prevalence of short {QT} interval in our cohort was in line with  previous studies. The incidence of cardiac symptoms/events, familial {SCDs} and {ECG}  derived specific findings were high amongst {SQTS}-susceptible index persons.  However, these variables could not predict the symptomatic subjects, which  emphasizes gene studies and family screening.},

The median age at diagnosis was 30 years (range 4–80). In all subjects, structural heart disease was excluded. Eighteen patients were symptomatic (62\%): 10 had cardiac arrest (34\%) and in 8 (28\%) this was the first clinical presentation. Cardiac arrest had occurred in the first months of life in two patients. Seven patients had syncope (24\%); 9 (31\%) had palpitations with atrial fibrillation documented even in young subjects. At {ECG}, patients exhibited a {QT} interval ≤320 ms and {QTc} ≤340 ms. Fourteen patients received an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator ({ICD}) and 10 hydroquinidine prophylaxis. At a median follow-up of 23 months (range 9–49), one patient received an appropriate shock from the {ICD}; no patient on hydroquinidine had sudden death or syncope.Conclusion {SQTS} carries a high risk of sudden death and may be a cause of death in early infancy. {ICD} is the first choice therapy; hydroquinidine may be proposed in children and in the patients who refuse the implant.},

	abstract = {The radioligand [3H]dofetilide binds specifically to the delayed rectifier potassium channel and provides a biochemical approach to study interactions of Class {III} drugs with this channel. However, previous studies have examined the binding of [3H]dofetilide to cardiac myocytes only at extracellular potassium of 135 mm. Because previous electrophysiological studies have shown that hyperkalemia could alter the pharmacological responses to {IKrchannel} blockers, the hypothesis tested in this study was that changing ionic conditions would alter characteristics of [3H]dofetilide binding. Results: under physiological conditions (Na+135 mm, K+5 mm), [3H]dofetilide bound to two sites on guinea-pig ventricular myocytes (a high-affinity site, Kd26±8 nm, Bmax81±12 fmol/106cells; and a low-affinity site, Kd1.6±0.8μm , Bmax1003±173 fmol/106cells,n=11). Binding properties were not altered by changes in osmolarity or extracellular sodium. However, when extracellular K+was increased to 20 mm, a single binding site was observed with an affinity Kdof 120±12 nmand a Bmaxof 303±57 fmol/106cells (P{\textless}0.05;n=6). To establish whether this effect was mediated at the high-affinity site we assessed the effects of elevated extracellular potassium on a biological model, neonatal mouse myocytes, that expressed solely the high-affinity binding sites. The Kdvalues for binding to fetal mouse cardiac myocytes at an extracellular K+of 5 mmand 20 mmwere also significantly different, 29±10 and 230±46 nm, respectively. In conclusion, [3H]dofetilide binding to its high-affinity site is modulated by extracellular potassium.},

	abstract = {Abstract There are many cardiac arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death ({SCD}) related to channelopathies or ion channel disorders. Short {QT} syndrome ({SQTS}) is an inherited cardiac channelopathy principally caused by defective functioning of both potassium–calcium ion channel that lead to abnormal shortening of {QT} interval, and an increased risk of ventricular and atrial arrhythmias. Tall T waves in all lead electrocardiogram ({ECG}), peaked T waves, and narrow-based T waves that are reminiscent of the typical “desert tent” T waves of hyperkalemia are frequently associated with {SQTS}. Diagnosis is based on patient's family history, evaluation of symptoms (palpitations and cardiac arrest), and 12-lead {ECG}. It can be time challenging because of the wide range of {QT} interval in healthy subjects. Implantable cardioverter defibrillator ({ICD}) is the first-line therapy in {SQTS}. Quinidine has the potential to be an effective pharmacological therapy for {SQTS} patients, especially in young children who are not feasible in {ICD} implantation, because of the ability to prolong {QT} interval.},

	abstract = {Heart failure ({HF}) is a major public health issue, imposing substantial costs on healthcare systems and societies. This study aimed to provide a contemporary overview of its global economic impact.A systematic search of four databases was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Studies reporting direct cost ({DC}) and/or indirect cost ({IC}) associated with {HF} were included. {DC} and {IC} were expressed as a percentage of current healthcare expenditure ({CHE}) and gross domestic product ({GDP}), which were obtained for 2021 from the World Health Organization Global Health Expenditure Database. Countries were categorized by their Human Development Index ({HDI}), and weighted group means were calculated to estimate costs based on their 2021 expenditure.Thirty-two studies met the inclusion criteria. In 2021, the estimated economic burden of {HF} was \$284.17 billion across 179 countries. This included \$136.86 billion (48.16\%) in {DC} and \$147.31 (51.84\%) billion in {IC}. Very high {HDI} countries account for most absolute {HF} spending, but {HF} comprises a smaller share of {CHE} and {GDP} (1.07\% {DC}, 0.09\% {IC}) compared with low {HDI} countries (8.85\% {DC}, 0.29\% {IC}).The global economic burden of {HF} is substantial, increasing, and varies across countries. Although very high and high {HDI} countries carry most of the absolute costs, low {HDI} countries bear a disproportionate burden relative to their total healthcare expenditure or {GDP}. Data scarcity in these settings further impedes accurate burden estimates. To address this growing challenge, proactive and cost-effective measures tailored to each country’s healthcare system are crucial in optimizing {HF} care worldwide.},
